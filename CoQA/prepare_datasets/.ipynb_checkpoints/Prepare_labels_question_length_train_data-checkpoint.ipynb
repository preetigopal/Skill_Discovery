Formally established in 1475 , although it is much older , it is one of the oldest libraries in the world and contains one of the most significant collections of historical texts . It has 75,000 codices from throughout history , as well as 1.1 million printed books , which include some 8,500 incunabula . The Vatican Library is a research library for history , law , philosophy , science and theology . The Vatican Library is open to anyone who can document their qualifications and research needs . Photocopies for private study of pages from books published between 1801 and 1990 can be requested in person or by mail . In March 2014 , the Vatican Library began an initial four - year project of digitising its collection of manuscripts , to be made available online . The Vatican Secret Archives were separated from the library at the beginning of the 17th century ; they contain another 150,000 items . Scholars have traditionally divided the history of the library into five periods , Pre - Lateran , Lateran , Avignon , Pre - Vatican and Vatican . The Pre - Lateran period , comprising the initial days of the library , dated from the earliest days of the Church . Only a handful of volumes survive from this period , though some are very significant .], start_position: 31, end_position: 37"
